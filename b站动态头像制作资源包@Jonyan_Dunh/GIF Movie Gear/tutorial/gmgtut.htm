    </font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">GIF Animations are essentially the sequential
    display of a series of static GIF images. The GIF format allows for a single GIF file to
    contain multiple GIF images. In a GIF animation, these GIF images are referred to as
    frames. Basically, each frame of a GIF animation is created from and composed of a single
    static GIF image. These static GIF images are typically created with any number of
    computer graphic applications including photo editing applications such as Adobe
    Photoshop, vector applications (that export to GIF) such as CorelDRAW, or 3D applications
    such as Ray Dream Studio.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">In this tutorial, we will walk you
    through the basic process of creating, editing, and optimizing a GIF animation with GIF
    Movie Gear (GMG). The tutorial can be thought of as two separate lessons: Getting Started
    and Optimization Techniques:</font></p>

    </font><font size="3"><b><p></b></font><a name="load"><font face="Arial" size="4">Loading
    Frames</font></a><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font size="2" face="Arial">Begin by opening up GMG and then select <em>Insert
    Frames</em> from the <em>File</em> menu or click the toolbar button<img src="b_insfr.gif" align="middle" border="0" hspace="2" width="23" height="22">. There are four files named <i>alien1.gif</i>, <i>alien2.gif</i>,
    <i>alien3.gif</i>, and <i>alien4.gif</i>. These files were created with CorelDRAW and
    Adobe Photoshop. Click on the <i>alien1.gif</i> file. Now, hold down on the shift key and
    click on the <i>alien4.gif</i> file. All four GIF files should be selected as a result of
    this operation. Hit OK to open the files in GMG (Figure 1). [If the files were not listed
    in the dialog, they can be found in the /tutorial/samples subfolder of where GIF Movie
    Gear was installed. The default is C:\Program Files\gamani\GIFMovieGear.]<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2"><i>You can also use the Open command to
    load animation frames. However, GMG will always start a new animation when you use the
    Open command. If you already have frames loaded, you can add more frames to the animation
    using the Insert Frames command, but if you use the Open command, GMG will start a new
    animation (prompting you first to save any unsaved changes to the previously opened
    animation).</i></font><font size="2"></p>
    </font><p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><img border="0" src="fig1.gif" vspace="5" width="624" height="330"><br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Figure 1</font></p>
    <font size="4"><b><p></b><a name="order"><font face="Arial">Ordering Frames</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font size="2" face="Arial">While it may not be readily obvious, all of the
    frames of the animation have been opened in the correct order. The first frame of the
    animation should be the little spaceship/alien with no little yellow ring below it. In the
    second frame there should be a large yellow ring below the spaceship and in the last two
    frames the yellow ring gets smaller and further away from the spaceship.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">These frames were imported in the
    correct order because they were saved in that order and because of how GMG imports GIF
    files according to how they are named. In other words, the GIF file that was intended to
    be the first frame was saved as <i>alien1.gif</i>, the GIF file that was intended to be
    the second frame was saved as <i>alien2.gif</i>, and so on. GMG orders multiple GIF files
    alpha/numerically. Since all of the GIF files have the same name except for the number at
    the end of the name, GMG used the numbers to determine their frame order. As a further
    example, if we had files named <i>a.gif</i>, <i>b.gif</i>, and <i>c.gif</i>, etc., GMG
    will place the <i>a.gif</i> file first and the <i>c.gif</i> file last. <br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">GMG allows you to see all of your frames
    at once. Click on the <i>Zoom Out</i> toolbar button<img src="b_zoomou.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="23" height="22">if you cannot see all the frames in your animations. Now Click and
    hold down the mouse on the first frame of the animation and then drag it to the right. As
    you drag, notice the black I-beam line that shows up in between the frames (within the
    gray borders that separate the frames). This I-beam lines indicates where the frame will
    be placed when you let up on the mouse. Drag the first frame all the way to the right and
    let go of the mouse when the I-beam line shows up on the gray border at the far right side
    of the last frame. When you do this, the first frame will be repositioned and it will now
    be the last frame.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">If the last frame is not already
    selected, select it again. Now select <i>Cut</i> from the <i>Edit</i> menu or use the
    industry standard keyboard shortcut (<i>Ctrl+X</i>). Next, click on the first frame of the
    animation and then select <i>Paste</i> from the <i>Edit</i> menu or press <i>Ctrl+V</i>.
    Now the frame will be repositioned at the beginning of the animation. This demonstrates
    that GMG pastes frames in front of the selected frame. So, you can either reorder frames
    by dragging and dropping them into position or by cutting and pasting them. Incidentally,
    a paste goes to the end of the animation when no frames are selected and the <i>File&gt;Insert
    Frames</i> command conforms to the same paste locations as the Paste command. <br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Before we move on, we have a few
    suggestions and notes that you should be aware. First, in this example, the files are
    numbered alien 1-4. If you have more than 9 frames in your animation, we suggest that you
    use double digit numbers. For example, frame 1 would be &quot;frame01.gif&quot;, frame 5
    would be &quot;frame05.gif&quot;, frame 10 would be &quot;frame10.gif&quot;, and so on.
    Doing this will ensure that animations with frames over 9 frames will be arranged in the
    proper order when you import multiple frames at once. Also note that names only matter
    when you are opening multiple frames at once. There is no automatic ordering when you
    import one frame at a time. </font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font size="4"><b><p></b><a name="preview"><font face="Arial">Previewing the
    Animation</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Now let&#146;s preview the animation. Click on the <i>Show
    Animation Preview</i> toolbar button<img src="b_prev.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="23" height="22">or use the keyboard shortcut: <i>Ctrl+P</i>. When you do this you will see the
    animation play in the <i>Preview Animation</i> dialog box exactly as it would on a web
    page, including frame timing (which we&#146;ll cover in a second).<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">There are several handy options in the
    Preview Animation dialog box that you should become familiar with. First notice that you
    can zoom in and out while you preview an animation. The preview dialog box is resizeable,
    so you can zoom in on your animation and then scrutinize the smallest detail as the
    animation plays. Also notice the standard VCR-like controls/buttons for stopping, going to
    the first frame (rewinding), jumping to the last frame, and stepping back and forth
    through frames one at a time.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Notice that the background of the
    preview dialog box defaults to a medium gray color. You can change this color. To do this,
    click on the <i>View Background As</i> button (the small monitor icon<img src="b_viewbk.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="19" height="18">in the bottom center of the dialog
    box). Doing this will open the standard <i>Windows Color Picker</i> dialog box. Click on
    the little black rectangle in the bottom left corner of the &quot;Basic colors&quot;
    section of the Colors dialog box and then hit OK. <br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Now the animation is previewed over a
    black background. This features allows you to preview how an animation will look over a
    given color background which can be very handy if you use solid color web page backgrounds
    on your web site. For instance, if you look very closely you will notice that while the
    example animation&#146;s background appeared to be black, it is actually a very dark gray.
    Consequently, the animation&#146;s border stands out from the background. In other words,
    if this animation were placed on a Web page with a black background, it would not
    integrate with the background color seamlessly. Now we will look at how to fix this
    problem.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">To close the <i>Animation Preview</i>
    window, click on the <i>X</i> in the upper right corner or hit the <i>Esc</i> button.</font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font size="4"><b><p></b><a name="color"><font face="Arial">Editing Colors in an
    Animation</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Click on the <i>Edit Global Palette</i> button<img src="b_gpal.gif" align="center" hspace="2" border="0" width="23" height="22">on the toolbar or select <i>Edit
    Global Palette</i> from the <i>Animation</i> menu. This brings up the palette editing
    dialog. Place your mouse somewhere over the black background in the animation in the
    preview window. The mouse cursor will change to an eye dropper cursor. A small pop up tag
    will display the Red, Green, and Blue values under the bottom left tip of the eye dropper
    cursor. Click when the pop up tag reads something like &quot;R=18, G=20, B=21&quot;.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">This should select the first color
    square in the color table to the left of the preview window. The selected color swatch is
    indicated by a red outline around it. Now enter 0 for the Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B)
    values (located below the color swatches). You have now changed the background color to
    pure black. If you look in the preview window you will see that you can no longer see the
    border between the background and the animation.</font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font size="4"><b><p></b><font face="Arial"><a name="timing">Editing Timing</a><b> </b></font></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Now we will look at how to adjust timing and
    looping of the animation in GMG. Click on the first frame. Now double-click in the field
    next to the little clock icon <img src="b_clock.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="17" height="17">on
    the toolbar. Enter a value of 50. Frame delays in GIF animations are measured in
    one-hundredths of a second. So, by entering a value of 50 in this field we have set this
    frame to display for half of a second. The default timing for each frame is 10 which is
    1/10<sup>th</sup> of a second. In other words, animations play at a rate of 10 frame a
    second in GMG by default. (<i>The default setting can be set in the Edit&gt;Preferences&gt;Animation
    dialog</i>.)<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">We have changed the frame delay for only
    the first frame. All three of the other frames are still set to 10 or 1/10<sup>th</sup> of
    a second. Click on the <i>Preview </i>button on the toolbar. Observe that now the
    animation pauses briefly on the first frame, plays the last three frames quickly, and then
    pauses on the first frame again. You can leave the preview window open while you make the
    following timing changes. GMG&#146;s preview window will automatically reflect any timing
    changes you make in the preview dialog box.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">You can also adjust individual frame
    delays with the <i>Frame Properties</i> dialog box. Double-click on the third frame or
    select the third frame and click on the <i>Frame Properties</i> button<img src="b_fprop.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="23" height="22">on the toolbar or select the third
    frame and select <i>Properties</i> from the <i>Frame</i> menu. Double-click on the first
    field under the <i>Animation</i> section of the dialog box (the field that is followed by
    the text that reads &quot;1/100th seconds delay after frame&quot;). Enter a value of 200
    and then hit OK. What does this do? Well, we have changed the value to 200/100ths of a
    second. This frame will now display for 2 seconds as you can see if you watch the
    animation preview again.</font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">This animation
    doesn&#146;t look very good with frame 1 set to display for half a second and frame 3 set
    to play for two seconds. It looked much better when all the frames played at the same
    rate. Fortunately, GMG allows you to make global changes to an animation, including frame
    delay edits. To do this, select <i>Global Properties</i> from the <i>Frame</i> menu.
    Notice that the dialog looks almost exactly like the <i>Frame Properties</i> dialog; the
    difference is that any changes made here will affect <i>all</i> of the frames in the
    animation, not just one. Click in the first field below the <i>Animation</i> section, type
    the number 5 and hit OK. This will change all of the frame delays to 5/100ths of a second.
    Now look at the animation in the <i>Preview Animation</i> dialog box and watch that sucker
    go!</font></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font size="4"><b><p></b><a name="loop"><font face="Arial">Editing Looping</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Now we will adjust the looping setting. Close
    the Preview window. Double click in the field next to the looping arrow<img src="b_loop.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="17" height="17">on the toolbar. Enter a value of 5.
    Click on the Preview button and you will see the animation play five times and then stops.
    Like timing you can also set the looping </font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">As you can see, the
    looping setting determines how many times the animation replays. You can set an animation
    to play anywhere from only one time to continuous looping. A setting of &quot;0&quot;
    plays the animation continuously and any other number establishes the actual number of
    times the animation will loop. For instance, if you enter 10 for the loop setting, the
    animation will play 10 times and then stop. GMG allows you to adjust the looping settings
    either via the toolbar or the <i>Animation Properties</i> dialog box. </font></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font size="4"><b><p></b><a name="save"><font face="Arial">Saving an Animation</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Now is a good time to save the animation using the <i>File</i>
    menu. Saving the animation essentially creates the animation. Use <i>Save
    As</i>&nbsp; or <i>Save</i> or&nbsp;<i> Save GIF Animation As</i> to create your animation. Thereafter you can use <i>Save</i> to save any further
    edits to an animation and using <i>Save As</i> will save a unique version of the
    animation. Using the&nbsp;<i> Type</i> dropdown in the <i>Save As</i>
    dialog, you can choose the file format to which the animation will be saved.
    Some of these formats (for example, AVI) allow different saving options,
    which are shown once the file type is selected.</font><font SIZE="5"><b></p>
    <p></b></font><a name="html"><font face="Arial" size="4">Adding to a Web Page</font></a><font SIZE="5"><b></p>
    <p></b></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Now the animation is ready to be added to a Web
    page (such as this one). Select the <em>HTML</em> item from the <em>File</em> menu. The
    &quot;HTML Code&quot; box at the bottom of the dialog contains the HTML code that should
    be added to your Web page in order to place the animation there. Options are provided for
    adding a label/hint, a link, and a border. For example, the finished animation below was
    placed on this page with an HTML statement similar to the following:</font><br>
    <b><font size="3"><code>&lt;img src=&quot;alienani.gif&quot; width=111 height=158 border=0

    <p><font face="Arial">Optimization Techniques with GIF Movie Gear</font></font><font SIZE="4"></p>
    <p></font></b><a name="optimize"><font face="Arial" size="4">Optimizing Animations</font></a><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">When we talk about &quot;optimizing&quot; an
    animation we are referring to reducing its file size. The smaller the file size of an
    animation, the faster it will download over the Internet. Usually the goal is to make an
    animation&#146;s file size as small as possible while keeping the animation itself as
    presentable as possible. There are many different ways to optimize a GIF animation. Here
    are the possible ways to optimize a GIF animation:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">1. Reduce the number of colors used<br>
    2. Use &quot;Dirty Rectangle&quot; Optimization<br>
    3. Use transparency for Inter-frame Optimization<br>
    4. Remove frames<br>
    5. Crop the animation&#146;s physical size<br>
    6. Resize the animation to a smaller physical size</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">GIF Movie Gear can perform all of these optimizations. Let&#146;s
    look at each one. However, before we start let&#146;s make a note of the animation&#146;s
    file size before optimizations. GMG provides this information in the status bar at the
    bottom of its interface. At the far bottom left you will see the total number of frames in
    the animation along with which frame is currently selected. The next box to the right
    shows the dimensions of the animation followed by the total running time. Next to this you
    will see the current file size of the animation along with its estimated download time at
    a given Internet connection speed (you can change the Internet connection speed that GMG
    targets with the <i>Download Time</i> item located in the <i>View</i> menu). The last box
    shows the current zoom state.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">This animation should be approximately
    7,153 bytes (the exact number will depend on your <i>GIF Signature</i> setting
    in <i>Edit&gt;Preferences&gt;Export</i>) which would take approximately 2 seconds to download over the Internet.
    Although two seconds isn&#146;t a very long time, we can shave some bytes off of this
    animation so that it will download even faster.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">NOTE: The effectiveness of the above
    optimization methods vary from animation to animation. All of the specifics discussed
    below include numbers that are specific to our sample animation. Results will vary
    depending on the animation being produced.</font></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font SIZE="4"><b><p></b><a name="reduce"><font face="Arial">Reducing Colors</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">This particular animation has very few colors
    in it (take a look at the colors using <i>Animation&gt;Edit Global Palette</i>), so it is
    already somewhat &quot;optimized.&quot; This is because the colors in all of the
    files/frames amounted to only 35 colors when the frames were imported into GMG. In other
    words, the animation&#146;s &quot;global palette&quot; (the palette used for all of the
    frames) contains only 35 colors. Animations that use a global palette can contain up to
    256 colors. Typically, the more colors there are in an animation, the larger its file
    size. Due to how the GIF format compresses, this is not always true, but this
    generalization holds true for the majority of GIF animations.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">You can reduce the number of colors in
    the animation by either clicking on the <i>Reduce Colors</i> button<img src="b_redcol.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="23" height="22">on the toolbar or by selecting the <i>Reduce Colors</i>
    option from the <i>Animation</i> menu. Figure 2 shows the <i>Reduce Colors</i> dialog box
    which features two preview windows for the animation. The window on the left shows the
    original animation and the window on the right shows the animation after it has been color
    reduced. These side by side windows allow you to see the animation before and after color
    reduction, which allows you to determine whether or not the color reduction adversely
    affects the animation&#146;s visual quality. GIF Movie Gear even allows you to zoom in
    within the preview windows to scrutinize the differences more closely.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="fig2.gif" vspace="5" width="596" height="451"><font face="Arial"><br>
    Figure 2</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">In our example,
    GMG automatically set the &quot;Number of colors in reduced palette&quot; drop down menu
    to a 32 color (5-bit) palette. Since this only removes 3 colors from the animation, go
    ahead and select 16 color (4-bit) from the &quot;Number of colors in reduced palette&quot;
    drop down menu. Now press play and compare the two variations. The preview on the left
    plays the original 35 color animation and the preview on the right plays the new 16 color
    version of the animation.</font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Notice that there is
    very little difference between the two versions of the animation. That&#146;s the key.
    Also notice that the preview windows provides before-and-after file size information. In
    figure 2, the information below the right window indicates that going from a
    34 color
    palette to 16 color palette will remove 1089 bytes from the animation and that the
    1089 bytes saved amounts to a 14.4% file size savings. Reducing the animation to a 16 color
    palette reduced the overall animation down to 6,334 bytes.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">If you look very carefully, you will
    notice that the yellow &quot;propulsion rings&quot; have become slightly orange-ish after
    the palette reduction. You can fine-tune single colors like this using the <em>Edit Global
    Palette</em> as discussed earlier.</font></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font SIZE="4"><b><p></b><a name="dirty"><font face="Arial">&quot;Dirty
    Rectangle&quot; Optimization</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Dirty Rectangle Optimization refers to a
    method of optimization that involves cropping frames in a GIF animation to their smallest
    needed rectangle. These frames are then played one atop the other using pixel coordinates
    for placement. The best way to understand this is to look at an example. Our little space
    alien example animation doesn&#146;t benefit much from this type of optimization, so
    let&#146;s look at a different example.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">First let&#146;s look at Figure 3. As
    you can see, this animation is your basic bouncing ball animation. However, notice that
    the background (the yellow wall and the brown floor) have a noisy texture. Most
    importantly, notice that the background is identical in each frame: it is redundant
    information that is repeated over and over. This texture might make the animation a bit
    more interesting but it&#146;s not so good for file size. Before optimization, this
    animation is 39.6Kb. This animation would take 5.7 seconds to download with a
    56K modem. Fortunately we can do better than that.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">This operation has reduced the file size to only 11.5 Kb.
    That&#146;s an over 30K file size savings. Now the animation takes just 1.6 seconds to
    download. Much better.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">It helps to know what&#146;s happening
    with the &quot;dirty rectangle&quot; optimization option because of its impact on how you
    might design your animation frames, so let&#146;s quickly cover how this form of
    optimization works. Basically each of the frames after frame 1 have been reduced to the
    smallest needed rectangle. The duplicated or redundant portions of the frames are cropped
    out. So, each frame after frame one is actually simply a smaller GIF file. The smaller GIF
    files are displayed over the first frame using pixels coordinates for their placement.
    Since the smaller GIF images only partially cover the first frame, you can still see parts
    of the original frame as the animation plays.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">To verify this, double click on the
    second frame of the animation. This will open the Frame Properties dialog box. Notice that
    the Offset X and Offset Y options are (or should be) 26 and 12 respectively. These
    coordinates correspond to the top left corner of the image in the frame. Change these both
    to 1 and notice what happens. Now the contents of the second frame are positioned over the
    top left corner of the frame. Undo this change using <i>Edit&gt;Undo</i> or
    the keyboard shortcut <i>Ctrl+Z</i>.&nbsp;<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Now notice that frame 5-8 actually haven&#146;t been cropped to the
    smallest needed rectangle. All we need is the ball and the shadow, but areas to the left
    are still visible. This is because there are very slight changes in that region which GMG
    has detected. Fortunately we can easily fix this manually.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Click on frame 5 and select <i>Move/Crop</i>
    from the <i>Frame</i> menu. Notice that the GIF image for this frame is shown in the
    preview window with a bounding box around it. Click and drag the center square on the left
    side of the GIF image in the preview window. Drag to the left until the bounding
    box&#146;s left edge is almost touching the blue ball. Let up on the mouse and click
    OK.
    If you repeat this operation for frames 6, 7, and 8 (see Figure 5) you should be able to
    lop off another 2.5K or so from the animation&#146;s file size. The final animation still plays
    exactly the same as the original (<em><strong>no loss of data!</strong></em>), but the file size has
    dropped from 39.6Kb to 8.9Kb. </font></p>

    <p></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">An additional way to optimize an animation is
    to make the rest of the redundant portions of animation, those that are inside the
    &quot;dirty rectangles,&quot; transparent. This often results in file size savings. You
    may already be familiar with the fact that GIF file can contain transparency information.
    In other words, some colors in a GIF file can be made transparent. When parts of a GIF
    file are transparent, they show through to any background imagery behind them.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">For a static GIF image, this would mean
    that transparent portions of a GIF file would show through to the Web page&#146;s
    background color or texture. You can take advantage of transparency within animations as
    well. Essentially, a GIF frame can contain transparent areas that show through to earlier
    frames. We refer to this as &quot;Inter-frame Transparency.&quot;<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">All you need to do to optimize the
    animation with inter-frame transparency is click on the <i>Optimize Animation</i> button<img src="b_opt.gif" align="center" border="0" hspace="2" width="23" height="22">or select <i>Optimize</i> from the <i>Animation</i>
    menu. The <i>Frame Reduction</i> section has three options: &quot;Shrink frames to
    smallest needed rectangle,&quot; &quot;Replace duplicate pixels with transparency,&quot;
    and &quot;Remove unnecessary frame.&quot; We are only concerned with the first two options
    for the purpose of inter-frame transparency optimization. The &quot;Shrink frames to
    smallest needed rectangle&quot; option (which we just talked about in the &quot;Dirty
    Rectangle optimization&quot; section) must be selected before you can use the
    &quot;Replace duplicate pixels with Transparency&quot; option.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">The &quot;Replace duplicate pixels with
    transparency&quot; option takes the idea of making portions of GIF animation frames
    transparent a little further than the &quot;Dirty Rectangle&quot; method. The idea is to
    remove all unnecessarily redundant pixels between frames. Sometimes this results in a
    significant file size savings, but not always. As with most optimizations, it depends on
    the animation itself.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">For example, with the &quot;Replace
    duplicate pixels with Transparency&quot; on, the bouncing ball is reduced from 8.9Kb to
    7.2Kb--a tidy little savings accomplished without any loss of data. On the other hand on
    the alien spaceship example the was no savings. In the alien spaceship animation there are
    a lot of black pixels around the little space ship that are redundant between frames 2, 3,
    and 4, but this doesn&#146;t mean that making these areas transparent will decrease its
    file size--in fact it will likely increase the file size. Consequently, there is no
    difference in the optimization when you have the &quot;Replace duplicate pixels with
    transparency&quot; option on or off.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">This apparent lack of transparency is
    because GMG is smart about how it applies transparency. When it determines that a
    transparency option will actually increase the file size, it avoids actually applying that
    option. So, for alien spaceship example animation, GMG doesn&#146;t actually use
    inter-fame
    transparency even if you turn it on, because it would increase&#151;not decrease&#151;the
    animation&#146;s file size.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">In general, you can safely leave both of
    these options on and be confident that GMG will choose the best combination of
    inter-frame transparency optimization options that will result in the smallest file size or the large
    file size savings. They were discussed separately in this tutorial only for instructional
    reasons.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Incidentally, the &quot;Remove
    unnecessary frame&quot; option removes any duplicate frames in an animation. This feature
    is useful because some early GIF animation designers did not realize that each frame can
    have its own timing, so they used multiple copies of a given frame to build in pauses. For
    example, rather than timing a frame for a second, they would include 10 copies of the
    frame each timed at 10/100ths of a second. Those 9 extra frames added needlessly to the
    animation&#146;s file size.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">Finally notice that you can remove any
    inter-frame transparency and/or dirty rectangle cropping in any animation (including any
    animations you download from the Web) by selecting <i>Unoptimize </i>from the <i>Animation</i>
    menu. Below are the original and optimized versions of the bouncing ball animation:</font></p>

    frames</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Removing frames is simply a matter of selecting and
    deleting a frame. Of course, the fewer frames in an animation, the smaller the file size.
    In the spaceship animation, click on frame 4 and delete it. Notice that the resulting file
    size of the animation has been reduced to only 4,748 bytes a saving of almost 1,500 bytes.
    (You can restore the frame by using <i>Undo</i>, found in the <i>Edit</i> menu.) GMG also
    features an option called <i>Thin (Reduce Count)</i> (in the <i>Animation</i> menu). This feature
    automates the removal of frames. For instance, if you have an animation with 20 frames,
    you can have GMG remove every other frame to bring the animation down to only 10 frames.
    This feature is particularly useful for animations created from digital video.</font><b><font SIZE="4"></p>
    <p></font></b><a name="crop"><font face="Arial" SIZE="4">Cropping the animation</font><font face="Arial"> </font></a><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">As a general rule, the dimensions of a GIF animation
    should be no larger than they absolutely have to be. For example, our example animation
    (the spaceship) is now overly large after we&#146;ve deleted the last frame. No motion
    occurs over a significant portion of the bottom of the animation, so we can slice a bit
    off the animation&#146;s file size by cropping out this portion on all of the frames.<br>
    <img src="indent.gif" alt="indent.gif (46 bytes)" width="15" height="2">To do this, select the frame that
    contains artwork that extends furthest to the bottom (which was frame 3). Now choose <i>Crop</i>
    from the <i>Animation</i> menu. To crop the animation, you simply drag the handles of the
    marquee in the preview window to the position you wish to crop to. To crop this animation,
    click on the bottom center handle and drag up until the Height is about 150 pixels. GIF
    Movie Gear also allows you crop numerically and you can preview the results before
    cropping. Click OK. Cropping the animation should reduce its file size to 4,733 bytes.</font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    </font><font SIZE="4"><b><p></b><a name="resize"><font face="Arial">Resizing the animation</font></a></font><font SIZE="1"></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Reducing an animation&#146;s dimensions is an
    obvious way to reduce the file size of an animation. GIF Movie Gear allows you to resize
    animation with the <i>Resize</i> option available in the <i>Animation</i> menu. You can
    resize animations according to numerical pixel dimensions or percentages. There is a
    &quot;Maintain Aspect Ration&quot; option to keep the animation from becoming deformed.
    Resizing animations can adversely affect the palette and inter-frame transparency
    optimization so usually it is best to resize the animation before optimizing the palette
    or inter-frame transparency of the animation. Reducing the spaceship animation&#146;s
    dimensions by 80% of its cropped size results in a file size of 3,551 bytes.</font><font SIZE="1"></p>
